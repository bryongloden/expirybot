Hello!

This is a reminder that the PGP key below expires in {days_until_expiry} days on {friendly_expiry_date}.

fingerprint: {fingerprint}
long key id: {key_id}

https://keyserver.paulfurley.com/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search={key_id}

If you use GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) software, here's a reminder how
to extend the primary key and subkey for 3 months:

```
$ gpg --edit-key '{fingerprint}'
key 0
expire
3m
y
[repeat for subkeys: key 1, key 2 etc...]
save
```

And to push your updated key to the keyservers:

```
$ gpg --send-keys '{fingerprint}'
```

I hope this email has been helpful.

If this feels like spam, please tell me and I won't ever email you again.

Kind regards,

Paul
